#           This file replaces one that is auto-generated by CubeMX
#           If you are staring at a huge git diff, it's because you
#           have regenerated this file.
#
#           So, your mission, should you choose to accept it:
#           merge the generated stuff with the contents of SH2.mk
#           and then toss the diff altogether.
