*** Changes
***********
 
** Overall **
- Support for CMSIS Packs has been removed. The SDK is delivered as zip 
  file only.
 
** Drivers and libraries **
- The MSB and LSB macros have been renamed to MSB_32 and LSB_32. Code 
  using these macros should be changed to use either the 16- or the 
  32-bit variant.
 
** BLE **
- Multi-instance handling of Service client modules has been greatly 
  improved. The client examples now handle service discovery in the main
  application context. The main application context must manage which 
  client instance belongs to which connection link.
- The Multi-link Example has been modified to demonstrate multiple 
  client instances in a better way.
- The ble_app_multilink_peripheral example has been removed. 
  ble_app_blinky now acts as the peripheral for ble_app_multilink_central.
- Heart Rate Application with RTX: Support for nRF52 has been removed.
- The Peer Manager is no longer experimental.
- The following BLE examples now use Peer Manager:
    - Central: 
         Running Speed and Cadence Collector (ble_app_rscs_c)
    - Central and Peripheral: 
         BLE Relay (ble_app_hrs_rscs_relay)
         BLE LE Secure Connections Multirole (ble_app_multirole_lesc)
    - Peripheral: 
         Alert Notification (ble_app_alert_notification)
         Proximity (ble_app_proximity)
         Glucose (ble_app_gls)
         HID Keyboard Application with BLE pairing using NFC (experimental_ble_app_hids_keyboard_pairing_nfc)
- The behavior of Peer Manager and Device Manager has changed to reject 
  pairing requests from already bonded peer centrals.
- Several BLE peripheral examples now support the S332 SoftDevice.
- Minor bugfixes in DFU.
 
** ANT **
- The ANT bootloader was aligned to MBR version 2.0.0.
- The following ANT examples now support the S332 SoftDevice 
  (experimental):
    - ANT Bootloader/DFU
    - Message Types
 
** NFC **
- The Adafruit Tag Reader Example has been extended to show added NDEF 
  parsing functionality.
- The NFC Type 2 Tag HAL was improved with a workaround for supporting 
  low power mode.
 
** Proprietary **
- A new implementation of the Enhanced ShockBurst (ESB) protocol 
  supporting both nRF51 and nRF52 has been added.
 
*** Fixed issues
****************
 
** Drivers and libraries **
- GPIOTE: Fixed the problem of lost events in low-accuracy sense toggle 
          mode
- SAADC: Added functionality to use one AIN with multiple channels
- UART: Fixed a glitch on TX pin when initializing the driver
- UART: Fixed the problem that TX bytes were sent in wrong order in 
        app_uart_fifo
 
** BLE **
- Removed a vulnerability in Peer Manager and Device Manager that would 
  allow malicious attackers to overwrite the bonding information of a 
  bonded device
 
** ANT **
- Fixed the handling of send-until-success request types in the ANT 
  request controller
- Fixed an ant_evt_t structure member alignment bug
 
** NFC **
- Fixed the NFC examples to work when the UART logger is enabled
- Fixed a buffer leakage bug in the module for creating 
  application/vnd.bluetooth.le.oob records
 
*** Known issues
****************
 
** Drivers and libraries **
- Using the NVIC API directly and not through a SoftDevice causes 
  problems, especially when NVIC_EnableIRQ or NVIC_DisableIRQ are called
  from critical sections.
 
** BLE **
- All BLE examples have been tested only on PCA10028 and PCA10040.
- BLE Examples that use pairing are incompatible with examples in SDK 
  version 6.1 and earlier that do not use pairing.
 
** ANT **
- Previous versions of the ANT DFU example are incompatible with the ANT
  S212/S332 SoftDevices version 0.9.x.
 
** NFC **
- NFCT requires using TIMER4 on nRF52832.
 
** FPU **
- When the FPU is in use, it triggers the FPU_IRQn interrupt when one of
  the six exception flags (IDC, IXC, UFC, OFC, DZC, IOC) is set.
  The FPU interrupt will always set the pending flag (even if the 
  interrupt is not enabled), irrespective of whether the user is 
  interested in the exception bit.
  The pending flag then prevents the SoftDevice from going into low 
  power mode when sd_app_evt_wait() is called.
  Therefore, always clear the exception bits and the pending interrupt 
  before calling sd_app_evt_wait(). See the code below for an example 
  implementation.
  FPU exception bit definition:
  http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0553a/BABBFJEC.html
  Example code:
  {
  // Set bit 7 and bits 4..0 in the mask to one (0x ...00 1001 1111)
  #define FPU_EXCEPTION_MASK 0x0000009F 
 
  ...
      /* Clear exceptions and PendingIRQ from the FPU unit */
      __set_FPSCR(__get_FPSCR()  & ~(FPU_EXCEPTION_MASK));      
      (void) __get_FPSCR();
      NVIC_ClearPendingIRQ(FPU_IRQn);
 
      /* Call SoftDevice Wait For event */
      error_code = sd_app_evt_wait();
  }

BLE:

  Changes:
  - All BLE examples have been tested only on PCA10028 and PCA10040.
  - The S13x SoftDevice v2.0.0-7.alpha is configurable, which leads to a
    variable RAM setup:
      - Added a macro to the softdevice_handler module to check the RAM 
        configuration against the SoftDevice parameters.
      - Added a wrapper function for the sd_enable function to the

    For other devices and boards, see the SDK documentation, section "Using
    the SDK with other boards".
  
Changes:
    
  Drivers and libraries:
    New features:
        - Ported FreeRTOS to run on nRF51. Added two FreeRTOS examples: one
          to run on bare metal and one running a BLE HRS example using the 
          S110 and S130 SoftDevices.
        - Added a TWI transaction manager module for managing access to an 
          I2C bus. Added an example that uses this module to control two 
          sensors on the same I2C bus.
        - Added an example that shows how to use the TWI driver.
        - Added a low-power PWM module (software-controlled low-accuracy 
          PWM). Added an example that shows how to use this module.
        - Added an LED softblink module that uses the low-power PWM. Added 
          an example that shows how to use this module. 
        - Ported app_uart to use the UART driver and moved it to the 
          libraries folder.
        - Ported app_gpiote to use the GPIOTE driver.
        - Added nrf_log, a logging module that supports printf and that can

    Fixed issues:
        - Mailbox module moved out of serialization.
        - Bug fixes in app_timer module.
        - App_timer module no longer requires to define the number of 
          timers used in the application.
        - Bug fixes in PWM module.
    Changes:
        - FIFO library: Extended APIs for multi-byte read and write to the 
          FIFO.
        - Memory Manager module:
                - Extended number of block categories to 7 (from 3).
                - More RAM-efficient management of memory blocks.
                - Added a diagnostic function to help determine the right

  ANT:
    New features:
     - Added the following new ANT modules: 
         - ant_encryption 
         - ant_key_manager
         - ant_search_config 
     - Extended/changed the following existing ANT modules:
         - ant_channel_config
         - ant_stack_config
         - ant_state_indicator      
     - Refactored the ANT/ANT+ examples and profiles to make them look more
       similar to the BLE profiles and examples:
         - The following ANT+ profiles have been extracted and extended: 
           Bicycle Power (ant_bpwr), Bicycle Speed & Cadence (ant_bsc), 
           Stride Based Speed & Distance (ant_sdm)
         - All ANT+ examples have been refactored to use extracted 
           profiles.
         - All ANT+/ANT examples have been refactored to use created 
           modules.
     - Added three new ANT examples:
         - ant_scalable
         - ant_scalable_encrypted
         - ant_scan_and_forward
 
    BLE:
     - Added an experimental module named Peer Manager. This module will 
       eventually replace the existing Device Manager. The new Peer Manager
       improves on the Device Manager in multiple ways, mainly by 
       supporting concurrent central and peripheral connections.
     - Added an experimental flash memory module named Flash Data Storage 
       (FDS), which greatly reduces the need for time-consuming write and 
       clear operations. When using FDS, data can be arbitrarily long or 
       short (within about a page). All pieces of data are tagged with 
       types, which makes it easy to version data.
     - Updated the experimental HRS/RSCS Relay example:
        - It now uses the new Peer Manager instead of the Device Manager. 
          Therefore, it now supports bonding in both central and peripheral
          roles.
        - It uses the new nrf_log module, which can use SEGGER RTT.
     - Removed the app_s130_demo example.
     - Added an experimental example supporting the Eddystone beacon 
       format.
     - Added the BLE Connection State module, which keeps track of certain 
       states of each connection (for example, whether it is encrypted) and
       can also keep track of user-defined states.
     - Added the Mapped Flags module, which keeps track of flags that are 
       mapped to keys. It is used by the BLE Connection State module.
     - Added ble_gatt_db.h (containing a GATT service structure) and 
       modified ble_db_discovery module to use it.
    BLE Services:
     - Updated the Bluetoothds_template application (experimental) to be 
       compatible with Bluetooth Developer Studio v1.0 and the Nordic 
       Semiconductor NRF5X v1.1.8 plugin.
     - Added three new services:
        - Location Navigation Service (experimental)
        - Proprietary LED Button Service (experimental)
        - Nordic UART Client Service (experimental)

Fixed issues:
     - App_pwm occasionally gives inverted signal.
  
Known issues:
    - Device Manager is not supported in multi-role S130 operation.
        - Device Manager works in peripheral or central only operation on 
          S130. This must be decided at compile time.
    - The DFU over BLE example has been tested to work with a minimum 
      connection interval of 11.25 ms. The application cannot handle 
      connection intervals lower than 11.25 ms and may undergo a system 
      reset in the middle of a firmware update.
      Workaround: If you face unexpected disconnects during the firmware
                  update process, consider increasing the connection 
                  interval used by the master.
    - The old manual procedure for testing buttonless DFU, as specified in
      the documentation, can lead to the DFU process hanging or returning 
      an error when used with Master Control Panel 3.8 and newer.
    - Bootloader binaries (.bin files) generated with the GCC makefile 
      should not be used. Instead, generate the bootloader bin files using 
      nrfutils, found on GitHub.

      examples to run on the new PCA10040 development board with
      nRF52832 IC rev. Engineering B.

Libraries:
    - Extended the NFC HAL layer of the NFC library to support the NFCT 
      peripherial for both the chip version delivered with the nRF52 
      Preview Development Kit (Engineering A: QFAA-AA0, QFAA-AC0, 
      CGAA-AA0) and the chip version delivered with the nRF52 Development
      Kit (Engineering B: QFAA-BA0, QFAA-BB0, CHAA-AA0, CHAA-AB0).

Examples:
    - Added PCA10040 as target bord for the following examples:

      - NFC URL Record Application 

Known issues/workarounds:
    - To use the software workarounds implemented for PCA10036 (part 
      of nRF52 Preview Development Kit), globally define 
      HAL_NFC_ENGINEERING_A_FTPAN_WORKAROUND in your project.
    - The TIMER4 peripheral is used to implement one of the workarounds 
      for PCA10036. This workaround is not used for PCA10040.
    - The ble_app_hrs_pairing_nfc example is unable to wake up from 
      system off.

    ANT:
        - Both the S310 and the S210 SoftDevices now support an extended 
          number of ANT channels (16).
 
 
        Libraries:
            - Heart Rate Monitor Profile
            - ANT stack configuration
            - ANT channel configuration
            - ANT channel state indicator
            - ANT pulse simulator
         
        Examples:
            - The ANT HRM examples have been refactored.
            - The Bicycle Power examples (ant_bicycle_pwr) support S310.
  
    ANT + BLE (S310):
        The following examples were added:
        - Bluetooth LE and ANT combined heart rate example (ble_ant_app_hrm).
        - Experimental ANT Shared Channels (experimental_ant_shared_channel_master_to_master, 
          experimental_ant_shared_channel_slave).
 
    BLE:
     - Advertising module has a new mode: Low Duty Cycle Directed Advertising.
     - Running Speed and Cadence Client added as experimental.
     - Bluetooth Developer Studio template added as experimental.
     - Heart Rate Sensor example (ble_app_hrs) supports S310.
     - Running Speed and Cadence example (ble_app_rscs) supports S310.
     - Combined Peripheral and Central example added as experimental.
     - DFU Signing using Elliptic Curve Cryptography added as experimental
       (using the same elliptic curve and hashing algorithm as Bluetooth 
       Low Energy 4.2 Secure Connections).
 
Fixed issues:
     - Pstorage now supports updates of bond split across two pages.
     - Advertising module can be set to infinite time-out.
     - Corrected clock source in BLE multiactivity beacon example.
     - Serialization HCI transport layer: Receiving packet-buffer is not 
       freed while sending ACK or NACK.
  
Known issues:
    - Device Manager is not supported in multi-role S130 operation.
        - Device Manager works in peripheral or central only operation on 
          S130. This must be decided at compile time.
    - The DFU over BLE example has been tested to work with a minimum 
      connection interval of 11.25 ms. The application cannot handle 
      connection intervals lower than 11.25 ms and may undergo a system 
      reset in the middle of a firmware update.
         Workaround: If you face unexpected disconnects during the firmware 
         update process, consider increasing the connection interval used
         by the master.
    - App_pwm occasionally gives inverted signal.
    - The old manual procedure for testing buttonless DFU, as specified in
      the documentation, can lead to the DFU process hanging or returning 
      an error when used with Master Control Panel 3.8 and newer.

Known issues:
    - Device Manager is not supported in multirole S130 operation.
        - Device Manager works in peripheral or central only operation on S130. This must be decided at compile time.
    - The DFU over BLE example has been tested to work with a minimum connection interval of 
      11.25 ms. The application cannot handle connection intervals lower than 11.25 ms and may 
      undergo a system reset in the middle of a firmware update.
        Workaround: If you face unexpected disconnects during the firmware update process, consider
        increasing the connection interval.

    - ANT:
        - NRFFOSDK-755: HRM TX buttons example may report wrong total elapsed time.

    - BLE:
        - A few APIs of the Device Manager are not implemented. Also, documentation providing 
          examples of how the API can be used is missing.
        - NRFFOSDK-2824: Device Manager (pstorage) does not support update of bond split across two 
          pages.

    - Proprietary:
        - The nRF24Lxx ESB examples found in the legacy nRFready SDKs do not work out of the box 
          with the nRF51 ESB examples. This is due to:
            - The legacy examples do not use "payload in ACK".
            - The legacy examples use RF channel 2 (not 10 as the nRF51 examples).
            - The examples do not use dynamic payload length.
          The legacy examples need to add the following to work with the nRF51 examples:
              hal_nrf_setup_dynamic_payload(0xFF);
              hal_nrf_enable_dynamic_payload(true);
              hal_nrf_enable_ack_payload(true);
              hal_nrf_set_rf_channel(10);
          In addition, the legacy PTX example must add code for handling the payloads received in ACK.
        - The Gazell Link Layer examples are not fully "out of the box" compatible with the legacy 
          Gazell examples provided in the nRFgo SDK for nRF24Lxx devices. The timeslot periods and 
          channel tables require adjustment.
            - Timeslot period: Edit the gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects or use the 
              nrf_gzll_set_timeslot_period() function in the nRF51 projects 
              (nRF51 Gazell timeslot period = 0.5*GZLL_RX_PERIOD).
            - Channel table: Edit the gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects or use the 
              nrf_gzll_set_channel_table() function in the nRF51 projects.
        - Gazell does not support "Low Power Host mode" (Host mode 1).

              SoftDevices.
        - Modules/Services:
            - Added a new advertising module (ble_advertising) that provides automatic handling of
              directed/fast/slow advertising, with and without whitelist.
            - Nordic UART Service (ble_nus), detached from the UART over BLE Example.
            - Added Current Time Service Client (ble_cts_c).
            - Service Changed characteristic has been implemented for DFU, so that the indication is
              sent when transitioning between application and bootloader.
            - Implemented a mechanism for sharing of IRK and LTK from application to bootloader. 
              This allows for whitelist advertising and reconnection in DFU mode using existing 
              keys.
        - Examples:
            - The UART over BLE Example is no longer experimental.
            - Added a Time Profile (ble_app_cts_c) example using the Current Time Service Client
              implementation.

Fixed issues:
    - Fixed pstorage issue where different applications could write to the same page.

Known issues:
    - The DFU over BLE example has been tested to work with a minimum connection interval of 
      11.25 ms. The application cannot handle connection intervals lower than 11.25 ms and may 
      undergo a system reset in the middle of a firmware update.
         Workaround: If you face unexpected disconnects during the firmware update process, consider

      See http://www.segger.com/IDE_Integration_Keil.html#knownproblems for details.
    - Keil 5.13 may issue a warning about missing packs even when all Nordic Semiconductor packs are
      correctly installed. 
    - The DFU over BLE example has been tested to work with a minimum connection interval of 
      11.25 ms. The application cannot handle connection intervals lower than 11.25 ms and may 
      undergo a system reset in the middle of a firmware update.
         Workaround: If you face unexpected disconnects during the firmware update process, consider
         increasing the connection interval used by the master.

    - ANT:
        - NRFFOSDK-755: HRM TX buttons example may report wrong total elapsed time

    - BLE:
        - NRFFOSDK-3135: S120 examples: RAM is limited to 16 kB, because S120 V1.0.1 does not 
          support utilizing the whole flash on the QFACAB chip
        - NRFFOSDK-119: Only the ble_app_proximity_low_power and ble_app_hrs applications are power 
          optimized
        - S120 examples: Flash clear operation may fail when connected. Impact of this in the S120 
          examples is that if the peer loses the bond and a rebonding occurs, flash clear fails and
          a DM_EVT_DEVICE_CONTEXT_STORED event is notified with a failure.
        - A few APIs of the Device Manager are not implemented. Also, documentation providing 
          examples of how the API can be used is missing.
        - NRFFOSDK-2824: Device Manager (pstorage) does not support update of bond split across two 
          pages.

    - Proprietary:
        - Temperature example does not give sane output values. This is a hardware-related issue
          described in PAN_028 and will be fixed in future silicon.
        - The nRF24Lxx ESB examples found in the legacy nRFready SDKs do not work out of the box 
          with the nRF51 ESB examples. This is due to:
            - The legacy examples do not use "payload in ACK".
            - The legacy examples use RF channel 2 (not 10 as the nRF51 examples).
            - The examples do not use dynamic payload length.
          The legacy examples need to add the following to work with the nRF51 examples:
                hal_nrf_setup_dynamic_payload(0xFF);
                hal_nrf_enable_dynamic_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_enable_ack_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_set_rf_channel(10);
          In addition, the legacy PTX example must add code for handling the payloads received in ACK.
        - The Gazell Link Layer examples are not fully "out of the box" compatible with the legacy 
          Gazell examples provided in the nRFgo SDK for nRF24Lxx devices. The timeslot periods and 
          channel tables require adjustment.
            - Timeslot period: Edit the gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects or use the 
              nrf_gzll_set_timeslot_period() function in the nRF51 projects 
              (nRF51 Gazell timeslot period = 0.5*GZLL_RX_PERIOD).
            - Channel table: Edit the gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects or use the 
              nrf_gzll_set_channel_table() function in the nRF51 projects.
        - Gazell does not support "Low Power Host mode" (Host mode 1).

Known issues:
    
    - When flashing from Keil 4, a pop-up might appear stating "Cannot Load Flash Device Description !".
          Solution:
            - Write new flash algorithm settings to the uvopt file. 
                Press ALT+F7 to open "Options for Target" dialog.
                Select "Options for Target" -> "Utilities".
                Press "Settings" button to see flashing algorithms.
                Verify that "nRF51xxx" is in the list of flashing algorithms, if not add it by pressing the "Add" button.
                Exit and save settings by pressing "OK". This is also important to do if you did find the "nRF51xxx" in the list of flashing algorithms.

    - If you have an existing KEIL project target set to use device variant "nRF51", a pop-up might appear stating that you have to "update your device selection".
        Solution:
            Press ALT+F7 to open "Options for Target" dialog.
            Select "Options for Target" -> "Device".
            Choose "Nordic nRF51 Series Devices" from the Database list.
            Select the variant of the nRF51 chip that is used for the KEIL project target.
    - When using J-Link software prior to version 4.66, a warning might appear when entering "Options for Target" -> "Debug" -> "Settings". The warning indicates that the device is unknown to the specific version of the J-Link software.
        Solution: Upgrade J-Link software to version 4.66 or later.
    - Segger J-Link software has some issues with Keil. See http://www.segger.com/IDE_Integration_Keil.html#knownproblems for more details.
    - On some Windows XP machines, J-Link CDC installer fails producing an error message saying it could not find JLinkCDCDriver_x86.msi.
        Solution: Try running the installer C:\Program Files\SEGGER\JLinkARM_V<version>\USBDriver\JLinkCDCInstaller_V1.2b.exe manually.
    - NRFFOETT-205 - The nRF51822 installer will not run if no C:\ drive exists
    - NRFFOSDK-236 - When the bundled J-Link OB CDC driver installation dialog appears, the error message "Failed to install driver (Timeout occurred)" might appear . Ignore it. 
    - NRFFOSDK-362 - Reset button won't work after programming without cycling the target power.
    - NRFFOSDK-363 - Flashing software using SEGGER is NOT possible when the device is in SYSTEM_OFF mode 
        Solution: Wake-up the current application from SYSTEM_OFF before flashing a new application.
    - The DFU over BLE example has been tested to work with a minimum connection interval of 11.25 ms. 
      This application will not be able to handle connection intervals lower than 11.25 ms and may undergo a system reset in the middle of a firmware update. 
      Workaround: If you face unexpected disconnects during firmware update process, consider increasing the connection interval used by the master.

    ANT
        - NRFFOSDK-366 - ANT-FS host: download sometimes fails when downloading a large file. 
        - NRFFOSDK-755 - HRM TX buttons example may report wrong total elapsed time. 

    BLE
        - NRFFOSDK-119 - Only the "....\Nordic\nrf51822\Board\nrf6310\ble\ble_app_pwr_profiling\","....\Nordic\nrf51822\Board\pca10001\ble\ble_app_proximity\ ", and "....\Nordic\nrf51822\Board\pca10001\ble\ble_app_hrs\ " applications are power optimized.
        - S120 Examples: Flash clear operation may fail when connected. Impact of this in the S120 examples is that if peer loses the bond and a re-bonding occurs, flash clear fails, and DM_EVT_DEVICE_CONTEXT_STORED event is notified with a failure.
        - Device manager has a few APIs unimplemented. Also documentation providing examples of how API can be used is missing.
        - NRFFOSDK-2824: Device manager (pstorage) doesn't support update of bond split across two pages.
        
    Proprietary:
        - NRFFOSDK-1769: Not all examples have makefiles, nor have they been tested with the new toolchain. Expect minor compilation issues.
        - Using Keil versions 4.53 and older will not work unless you change configuration in jlinksettings.ini. See User Guide for more details.
        - Temperature example does not give sane output values. This is hardware related issue described in PAN_028 and will be fixed in future silicon.
        - The nRF24Lxx ESB examples found in the legacy nRFready SDKs do not work out of the box with the nRF51 ESB examples. This is due to:
            - The legacy examples do not use "payload in ACK".
            - The legacy examples use RF channel 2 (not 10 as the nRF51 examples).
            - The examples do not use dynamic payload length.
            The legacy examples need to add the following in order to work with the nRF51 examples:
                hal_nrf_setup_dynamic_payload(0xFF);
                hal_nrf_enable_dynamic_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_enable_ack_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_set_rf_channel(10);
            In addition, the legacy PTX example must add code for handling the payloads received in ACK.  
            
        - The Gazell Link Layer examples are not fully "out of the box" compatible with the legacy Gazell examples provided in the nRFgo SDK for nRF24Lxx devices. The timeslot periods and channel tables require adjustment.
        - Timeslot period: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_timeslot_period() function in the nRF51 projects (nRF51 Gazell timeslot period = 0.5*GZLL_RX_PERIOD).
        - Channel table: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_channel_table() function in the nRF51 projects.
        - Gazell does not support "Low Power Host mode" (Host mode 1).

Changes:

    - Added partial support for Keil 5 uvprojx files.

    ANT
        - None
        
    ANT + BLE (Dual stack)
    
    BLE
        - New module device manager replaces bond manager for storing persistent data
        - Experimental device manager support for s120 (BLE central)
        - S110 serialization solution has been reworked
            - 100% s110 BLE APIs are now serialized
        - S110 support for application concurrent multiprotocol radio access
        - Pstorage module: Added API for doing range updates 
        - Experimental: Device firmware upgrade now supports updating both SoftDevice and bootloader for s110
        
    Proprietary
        - Enhanced ShockBurst: Added nrf_esb_reuse_pid() function to API, giving "reuse payload" functionality.
        - Gazell: Added "suspend" mode enabling sharing of radio and PPI. 
        - Gazell: HW resources are released when Gazell is being disabled or entering suspend mode.
        - Gazell: HW resources are reconfigured when Gazell is being enabled or exiting from suspend mode.
    
Fixed issues:
    
    - NRFFOSDK-2542 - SoftDevice related documentation for S110, S120 and S310 BLE stack is not consistent. When looking up SoftDevice application interface or message sequence charts, it is possible that one is looking at incorrect interface. Recommendation hence is to look at SoftDevice headers to ensure correct appplication interface. This is also applicable for Serialization library references. This will be fixed in next release.
        - SDK documentation has been splitted into 4 seperate documents with a common index page.
    
    ANT
        - None

    ANT + BLE (Dual stack)
        - S310 Heart Rate Relay Example: Bonding does not always function as expected. If bonding is enabled using compiler flag it is recommended to perform service discovery before bonding to minimize chances of unexpected behaviour.    

    BLE
        
    Proprietary
        - Enhanced ShockBurst/Gazell: Received packets in Host/PRX mode with CRC error can no longer return ACK to device.
        - NRFFOSDK-2470: app_timer - Fixed issue where starting and stopping the timer repeatedly caused errors in the module

Known issues:
    
    - When flashing from Keil 4, a pop-up might appear stating "Cannot Load Flash Device Description !".
          Solution:
            - Write new flash algorithm settings to the uvopt file. 
                Press ALT+F7 to open "Options for Target" dialog.
                Select "Options for Target" -> "Utilities".
                Press "Settings" button to see flashing algorithms.
                Verify that "nRF51xxx" is in the list of flashing algorithms, if not add it by pressing the "Add" button.
                Exit and save settings by pressing "OK". This is also important to do if you did find the "nRF51xxx" in the list of flashing algorithms.

    - If you have an existing KEIL project target set to use device variant "nRF51", a pop-up might appear stating that you have to "update your device selection".
        Solution:
            Press ALT+F7 to open "Options for Target" dialog.
            Select "Options for Target" -> "Device".
            Choose "Nordic nRF51 Series Devices" from the Database list.
            Select the variant of the nRF51 chip that is used for the KEIL project target.
    - When using J-Link software prior to version 4.66, a warning might appear when entering "Options for Target" -> "Debug" -> "Settings". The warning indicates that the device is unknown to the specific version of the J-Link software.
        Solution: Upgrade J-Link software to version 4.66 or later.
    - Segger J-Link software has some issues with Keil. See http://www.segger.com/IDE_Integration_Keil.html#knownproblems for more details.
    - On some Windows XP machines, J-Link CDC installer fails producing an error message saying it could not find JLinkCDCDriver_x86.msi.
        Solution: Try running the installer C:\Program Files\SEGGER\JLinkARM_V<version>\USBDriver\JLinkCDCInstaller_V1.2b.exe manually.
    - NRFFOETT-205 - The nRF51822 installer will not run if no C:\ drive exists
    - NRFFOSDK-236 - When the bundled J-Link OB CDC driver installation dialog appears, the error message "Failed to install driver (Timeout occurred)" might appear . Ignore it. 
    - NRFFOSDK-362 - Reset button won't work after programming without cycling the target power.
    - NRFFOSDK-363 - Flashing software using SEGGER is NOT possible when the device is in SYSTEM_OFF mode 
        Solution: Wake-up the current application from SYSTEM_OFF before flashing a new application.
    - The DFU over BLE example has been tested to work with a minimum connection interval of 11.25 ms. 
      This application will not be able to handle connection intervals lower than 11.25 ms and may undergo a system reset in the middle of a firmware update. 
      Workaround: If you face unexpected disconnects during firmware update process, consider increasing the connection interval used by the master.

    ANT
        - NRFFOSDK-366 - ANT-FS host: download sometimes fails when downloading a large file. 
        - NRFFOSDK-755 - HRM TX buttons example may report wrong total elapsed time. 

    BLE
        - NRFFOSDK-119 - Only the "....\Nordic\nrf51822\Board\nrf6310\ble\ble_app_pwr_profiling\","....\Nordic\nrf51822\Board\pca10001\ble\ble_app_proximity\ ", and "....\Nordic\nrf51822\Board\pca10001\ble\ble_app_hrs\ " applications are power optimized.
        - S120 Examples: Flash clear operation may fail when connected. Impact of this in the S120 examples is that if peer loses the bond and a re-bonding occurs, flash clear fails, and DM_EVT_DEVICE_CONTEXT_STORED event is notified with a failure.
        - Device manager has a few APIs unimplemented. Also documentation providing examples of how API can be used is missing.
        - NRFFOSDK-2824: Device manager (pstorage) doesn't support update of bond split across two pages.
        
    Proprietary:
        - NRFFOSDK-1769: Not all examples have makefiles, nor have they been tested with the new toolchain. Expect minor compilation issues.
        - Using Keil versions 4.53 and older will not work unless you change configuration in jlinksettings.ini. See User Guide for more details.
        - Temperature example does not give sane output values. This is hardware related issue described in PAN_028 and will be fixed in future silicon.
        - The nRF24Lxx ESB examples found in the legacy nRFready SDKs do not work out of the box with the nRF51 ESB examples. This is due to:
            - The legacy examples do not use "payload in ACK".
            - The legacy examples use RF channel 2 (not 10 as the nRF51 examples).
            - The examples do not use dynamic payload length.
            The legacy examples need to add the following in order to work with the nRF51 examples:
                hal_nrf_setup_dynamic_payload(0xFF);
                hal_nrf_enable_dynamic_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_enable_ack_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_set_rf_channel(10);
            In addition, the legacy PTX example must add code for handling the payloads received in ACK.  
            
        - The Gazell Link Layer examples are not fully "out of the box" compatible with the legacy Gazell examples provided in the nRFgo SDK for nRF24Lxx devices. The timeslot periods and channel tables require adjustment.
        - Timeslot period: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_timeslot_period() function in the nRF51 projects (nRF51 Gazell timeslot period = 0.5*GZLL_RX_PERIOD).
        - Channel table: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_channel_table() function in the nRF51 projects.
        - Gazell does not support "Low Power Host mode" (Host mode 1).

                Exit and save settings by pressing "OK". This is also important to do if you did find the "nRF51xxx" in the list of flashing algorithms.

    - If you have an existing KEIL project target set to use device variant "nRF51", a pop-up might appear stating that you have to "update your device selection".
        Solution:
            Press ALT+F7 to open "Options for Target" dialog.
            Select "Options for Target" -> "Device".
            Choose "Nordic nRF51 Series Devices" from the Database list.
            Select the variant of the nRF51 chip that is used for the KEIL project target.
    - When using J-Link software prior to version 4.66, a warning might appear when entering "Options for Target" -> "Debug" -> "Settings". The warning indicates that the device is unknown to the specific version of the J-Link software.
        Solution: Upgrade J-Link software to version 4.66 or later.
    - Segger J-Link software has some issues with Keil. See http://www.segger.com/IDE_Integration_Keil.html#knownproblems for more details.
    - On some Windows XP machines, J-Link CDC installer fails producing an error message saying it could not find JLinkCDCDriver_x86.msi.
        Solution: Try running the installer C:\Program Files\SEGGER\JLinkARM_V<version>\USBDriver\JLinkCDCInstaller_V1.2b.exe manually.
    - NRFFOETT-205 - The nRF51822 installer will not run if no C:\ drive exists
    - NRFFOSDK-236 - When the bundled J-Link OB CDC driver installation dialog appears, the error message "Failed to install driver (Timeout occurred)" might appear . Ignore it. 
    - NRFFOSDK-362 - Reset button won't work after programming without cycling the target power.
    - NRFFOSDK-363 - Flashing software using SEGGER is NOT possible when the device is in SYSTEM_OFF mode 
        Solution: Wake-up the current application from SYSTEM_OFF before flashing a new application.
    - The DFU over BLE example has been tested to work with a minimum connection interval of 11.25 ms. 
      This application will not be able to handle connection intervals lower than 11.25 ms and may undergo a system reset in the middle of a firware update. 
      Workaround: If you face unexpected disconnects during firmware update process, consider increasing the connection interval used by the master.

  
    ANT
        - NRFFOSDK-366 - ANT-FS host: download sometimes fails when downloading a large file. 
        - NRFFOSDK-755 - HRM TX buttons example may report wrong total elapsed time.

        - NRFFOSDK-472 - Bonding information in flash are not erased during programming of a new application.
            (If the bonding information is not erased manually - by pressing button 1 during start-up - the new application might assert. )
        - NRFFOSDK-2162 - Heart Rate application for PCA10001 possible inconsistent system attributes on power cycle. It is possible that the system attributes on power cycle are not consistent with the ones updated during previous connection.
       
    Proprietary:
        - NRFFOSDK-1769: Not all examples have makefiles, nor have they been tested with the new toolchain. Expect minor compilation issues.
        - Using Keil versions 4.53 and older will not work unless you change configuration in jlinksettings.ini. See User Guide for more details.
        - Temperature example does not give sane output values. This is hardware related issue described in PAN_028 and will be fixed in future silicon.
        - The nRF24Lxx ESB examples found in the legacy nRFready SDKs do not work out of the box with the nRF51 ESB examples. This is due to:
            - The legacy examples do not use "payload in ACK".
            - The legacy examples use RF channel 2 (not 10 as the nRF51 examples).
            - The examples do not use dynamic payload length.
            The legacy examples need to add the following in order to work with the nRF51 examples:
                hal_nrf_setup_dynamic_payload(0xFF);
                hal_nrf_enable_dynamic_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_enable_ack_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_set_rf_channel(10);
            In addition, the legacy PTX example must add code for handling the payloads received in ACK.  
            
        - The Gazell Link Layer examples are not fully "out of the box" compatible with the legacy Gazell examples provided in the nRFgo SDK for nRF24Lxx devices. The timeslot periods and channel tables require adjustment.
        - Timeslot period: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_timeslot_period() function in the nRF51 projects (nRF51 Gazell timeslot period = 0.5*GZLL_RX_PERIOD).
        - Channel table: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_channel_table() function in the nRF51 projects.
        - Gazell does not support "Low Power Host mode" (Host mode 1).

        Solution: Wake-up the current application from SYSTEM_OFF before flashing a new application.
    - The DFU over BLE example has been tested to work with a minimum connection interval of 11.25 ms. 
      This application will not be able to handle connection intervals lower than 11.25 ms and may undergo a system reset in the middle of a firware update. 
      Workaround: If you face unexpected disconnects during firmware update process, consider increasing the connection interval used by the master.

        - Temperature example does not give sane output values. This is hardware related issue described in PAN_028 and will be fixed in future silicon.
        - The nRF24Lxx ESB examples found in the legacy nRFready SDKs do not work out of the box with the nRF51 ESB examples. This is due to:
            - The legacy examples do not use "payload in ACK".
            - The legacy examples use RF channel 2 (not 10 as the nRF51 examples).
            - The examples do not use dynamic payload length.
            The legacy examples need to add the following in order to work with the nRF51 examples:

            In addition, the legacy PTX example must add code for handling the payloads received in ACK.  
            
        - The Gazell Link Layer examples are not fully "out of the box" compatible with the legacy Gazell examples provided in the nRFgo SDK for nRF24Lxx devices. The timeslot periods and channel tables require adjustment.
        - Timeslot period: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_timeslot_period() function in the nRF51 projects (nRF51 Gazell timeslot period = 0.5*GZLL_RX_PERIOD).
        - Channel table: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_channel_table() function in the nRF51 projects.
        - Gazell does not support "Low Power Host mode" (Host mode 1).

Changes:

    - Device Firmware Update example released as part of the main SDK.
      - Added support for image transfer over BLE.
      - HCI Transport Layer used for serial transfer.
      - Note: This example is implemented to work on nRF6310 motherboard because it uses Button 7 to enter bootloader mode on reset. 
	      This is because Button 0 and Button 1 are used by other SDK applications as wakeup buttons.
	      If this example is to be changed to work for evaluation kit board, then this should be taken into consideration.
      - PC application examples for performing firmware updates using HCI and BLE added in nrf6310\device_firmware_updates\experimental folder.

    - UICR Configuration example added to the SDK. It can be found in nrf6310\uicr_config_example folder.

nRF51 SDK v. 4.3.0
------------------

Following toolchains/devices have been used for testing and verification:
    - ARM: MDK-ARM Version 4.60
	- GCC: gcc-arm-embedded 4.7 2013q1
    - N51422 QFAACA on PCA10003 evaluation kit board

    - Windows XP SP3 32 bit
    - Windows 7 SP1 64 bit
    - BLE SoftDevice Version : s110_nrf51822_5.2.0

Changes:

    - Supported GCC toolchain switched from CodeSourcery to gcc-arm-embedded.
        - New gcc startup file, linker scripts, and makefiles.
        - Updated CMSIS header files in Include/gcc to the latest revision (3.20).
        - Makefile target "all" now runs "clean" and "debug" targets instead of incremental "release" target.
    - nrf.h requires projects to have a define for a chip to enable some needed workarounds.
	- SDK examples now support PCA10000 v2.0.0. To make the examples work on the older PCA10000 v1.0, the UART pins need to be remapped in the pca10000.h header file.
		For v1.0
			#define RX_PIN_NUMBER  3
			#define TX_PIN_NUMBER  1
			#define CTS_PIN_NUMBER 2
			#define RTS_PIN_NUMBER 0
		For v2.0.0
			#define RX_PIN_NUMBER  11
			#define TX_PIN_NUMBER  9
			#define CTS_PIN_NUMBER 10
			#define RTS_PIN_NUMBER 8
    
    ANT
            - ANT examples have been updated to support the newest UART API.
    BLE
	    - HCI Transport Layer from Bluetooth Specification v4.0 introduced for BLE S110 Serialized Applications. 
		- BLE S110 Serialization Examples released as part of the main SDK.
		- Updated serialized ble_app_advertising and ble_app_hrs to use app_scheduler.
	    - Connection Parameter update module : Added possibility to request different connection parameters multiple times. A new event, BLE_CONN_PARAMS_EVT_SUCCEEDED has been created. Event handler implementation needs to take this into account, especially if they were implemented to trigger a disconnect regardless of the type of event.
		- Added Makefile and Eclipse project file for ble_app_hrs.
		- Changed hard coded flash pages to be FICR CODESIZE dependent.
           
    Proprietary
        - Gazell:
			- Added Gazell Pairing Host source code and board example. Backwards compatible with nRF24L Gazell Pairing Device and Host modules.
			- Added function nrf_gzll_set_auto_disable(uint32_t num_ticks), to disable Gazell after a number of timeslots.
			- Added function nrf_gzll_get_tick_count().
			- Gazell Pairing Device now uses nrf_gzll_get_tick_count() in order to implement a delay. This reduces current consumption.
			- Default sync_lifetime value has been increased to 3*channel_table_size*number_of_timeslots_per_channel. This improves performance in high-interference environments. Current users who are satisfied with the performance may wish to maintain the minimum value of 1*channel_table_size*number_of_timeslots_per_channel, in order to avoid any slight increase in current consumption.
        - Enhanced ShockBurst:
			- ESB PTX now calls nrf_esb_tx_success() callback instead of nrf_esb_tx_failed() for NOACK packets.
			- Fix in nrf_esb_set_mode() 
        - Information concerning backwards compatibility with nRF24L devices has been moved to the User Guide.
		
Fixed issues:

    - Examples doing flash writes were not waiting for writes to finish.
    
    ANT
	    - NRFFOSDK-1312 - Changed ANTFS_TRANSMIT_POWER define in antfs.h from 0 to 3. The define previously had an incorrect definition which set the power value to -20dBm instead of 0dBm even though the comment indicated 0dBm. 

    BLE
	    - NRFFOETT-402 - DFU Bootloader application in experimental project now sets stack pointer correctly before executing reset vector of application.

    Proprietary
	    - NRFFOETT-301 - Radio example uses obsolete RADIO_TXPOWER_TXPOWER_Neg40dBm definition.
        - Fixed issue in TWI HW driver. Event was not cleared before waiting it to get cleared.
        - Floating point ABI used by Makefiles was incorrect. Now using mabi-float=soft.
        - Gazell/ESB: Fixed set_mode() functionality.
        - Gazell GCC board examples startup and run correctly with the GCC libraries.
        - A Gazell Device nows stop the RSSI measurement when no ACK is received, improving the base current consumption.

        - Using Keil versions 4.53 and older will not work unless you change configuration in jlinksettings.ini. See User Guide for more details.
        - Temperature example does not give sane output values. This is hardware related issue described in PAN_028 and will be fixed in future silicon.
        - The nRF24Lxx ESB examples found in the legacy nRFready SDKs do not work out of the box with the nRF51 ESB examples. This is due to:
            - The legacy examples do not use "payload in ACK".
            - The legacy examples use RF channel 2 (not 10 as the nRF51 examples).
            - The examples do not use dynamic payload length.
            The legacy examples need to add the following in order to work with the nRF51 examples:
                hal_nrf_setup_dynamic_payload(0xFF);
                hal_nrf_enable_dynamic_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_enable_ack_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_set_rf_channel(10);
            In addition, the legacy PTX example must add code for handling the payloads received in ACK.  
            
        - The Gazell Link Layer examples are not fully "out of the box" compatible with the legacy Gazell examples provided in the nRFgo SDK for nRF24Lxx devices. The timeslot periods and channel tables require adjustment.
        - Timeslot period: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_timeslot_period() function in the nRF51 projects (nRF51 Gazell timeslot period = 0.5*GZLL_RX_PERIOD).
        - Channel table: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_channel_table() function in the nRF51 projects.
        - Gazell does not support "Low Power Host mode" (Host mode 1).

            - The examples do not use dynamic payload length.
            The legacy examples need to add the following in order to work with the
            nRF51 examples:
            hal_nrf_setup_dynamic_payload(0xFF);
            hal_nrf_enable_dynamic_payload(true);
            hal_nrf_enable_ack_payload(true);
            hal_nrf_set_rf_channel(10);
            In addition, the legacy PTX example must add code for handling the
            payloads received in ACK.  
            
        - The Gazell Link Layer examples are not fully "out of the box" compatible with the legacy Gazell examples provided in the nRFgo SDK for nRF24Lxx devices. The timeslot periods and channel tables require adjustment.
          
        - Timeslot period: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_timeslot_period() function in the nRF51 projects (nRF51 Gazell timeslot period = 0.5*GZLL_RX_PERIOD).
        
        - Channel table: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_channel_table() function in the nRF51 projects.
        
        - Gazell does not support "Low Power Host mode" (Host mode 1).

Notification ANT:
    - This is last release that will support N51422 QFAACA (ANT). Next release will contain API changes.

        - Use of Whitelist added to Proximity, HID Mouse and HID Keyboard examples.
        - Use of directed advertisement added to HID Mouse and HID Keyboard examples.
        - Timer Module refactored.

    Proprietary:
        - Added nRF24L series address conversion functions to radio_example.
        - Added support for GCC to nRF51 Code Examples, ESB and Gazell examples.
        - Examples no longer use deprecated PERPOWER register.

        - Corrected location of SFR files in UV projects.

        - ESB: ESB PRX transceiver operations are shorted, removing continuous wave transmission and improving speed and current consumption. 
        - ESB: PRX starts listening immediately after sending an ACK, no longer waiting for the next timeslot.
        - ESB: The NOACK bit is changed to an ACK bit to ensure compatibility with L01 radios. The L01 product specification is incorrect, only devices using dynamic ack will see this. 
        - ESB: esb_is_enabled function added.
        - ESB: Disabling CRC checking on PRX/Host side works correctly
        - ESB: Added support for controlling the XOSC outside the ESB library

        - GZP: nrf_nvmc_write_bytes correctly iterates through bytes.

Fixed issues:
    - Examples use deprecated PERPOWER register. 

    Proprietary:
        - When using Keil ARM MDK v4.60 the ram retention, temperature and blinky examples might fail during compilation.
        - Gazell and ESB examples point to wrong SFR file (should be SFD\Nordic\nRF51\nRF51822.sfr). 

    Bluetooth:
          - The buttons on the evaluation board are not debounced.

Known issues:
    - Segger JLink has some issues with Keil. See http://www.segger.com/IDE_Integration_Keil.html#knownproblems for more details.
    - On some Windows XP machines JLink CDC installer fails with error message saying it could not find JLinkCDCDriver_x86.msi. 
      Try running the installer C:\Program Files\SEGGER\JLinkARM_V<version>\USBDriver\JLinkCDCInstaller_V1.2b.exe manually.
    - When the bundled JLink OB CDC driver installation dialog appears, it might pop up an error saying "Failed to install driver (Timeout occurred)". Ignore it. (DRGN-1807)
    - Reset button won't work after programing without cycling the target power. (DRGN-1885)
    - Flashing a software using SEGGER is possible only when NOT in SYSTEM_OFF mode (implies to wake-up the current application with a button press for example before flashing a new application).(DRGN-1925)
      
    Bluetooth:
        - Only the ..\Nordic\nrf51822\Board\nrf6310\ble\ble_app_pwr_profiling\ and ..\Nordic\nrf51822\Board\pca10001\ble\ble_app_hrs\ applications are power optimized.(DRGN-1914)
        - ble_bondmngr_store_bonded_masters function from the bond manager cannot be used when advertising nor when in a connection (DRGN-1915)
         (flash erase/write prevents the CPU from running which means the stack will not be able to run properly.) 
          If ble_bondmngr_store_bonded_masters function is called while advertising or in a connection, the behavior is UNDEFINED.

    Proprietary:
        - ESB/Gazell: Calling nrf_esb_init() or nrf_gzll_init() will disable usage of the GPIOTE peripheral. In order to use the GPIOTE peripheral, the workaround in PAN 22 must be performed after calling these functions.         
        - Using Keil versions 4.53 and older will not work unless you change configuration in jlinksettings.ini. See User Guide for more details.
        - Temperature example does not give sane output values. This is hardware related issue described in PAN_028 and will be fixed in future silicon.

        - The nRF24Lxx ESB examples found in the legacy nRFready
          SDKs do not work out of the box with the nRF51 ESB examples. This is due to:
        - The legacy examples do not use "payload in ACK".
        - The legacy examples use RF channel 2 (not 10 as the nRF51 examples).
        - The examples do not use dynamic payload length.

          The legacy examples need to add the following in order to work with the
          nRF51 examples:

          hal_nrf_setup_dynamic_payload(0xFF);
          hal_nrf_enable_dynamic_payload(true);
          hal_nrf_enable_ack_payload(true);
          hal_nrf_set_rf_channel(10);

          In addition, the legacy PTX example must add code for handling the
          payloads received in ACK.  

        - The Gazell Link Layer examples are not fully "out of the box" compatible 
          with the legacy Gazell examples provided in the nRFgo SDK for nRF24Lxx
          devices. The timeslot periods and channel tables require adjustment.
        - Timeslot period: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects,
          or use the nrf_gzll_set_timeslot_period() function in the nRF51 projects
          (nRF51 Gazell timeslot period = 0.5*GZLL_RX_PERIOD).
        - Channel table: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, 
          or use the nrf_gzll_set_channel_table() function in the nRF51 projects.
        - Gazell does not support "Low Power Host mode" (Host mode 1).







nRF518 SDK v1.1.1
-----------------

Changes:
- Master Control Panel updated to version 3.1.1. Includes fix for issue where pca10000 master emulator devices did not get detected.

Known issues:
- When the bundled JLink OB CDC driver installation dialog appears, it might pop up an error saying "Failed to install driver (Timeout occurred)". Ignore it.
- When using Keil ARM MDK v4.60 the ram retention, temperature and blinky examples might fail during compilation and leave an error message like this:
    C3900U: Unrecognized option '--asm'.
    C3900U: Unrecognized option '--interleave'.
  To fix this Click Alt+F7, choose "Listing" tab. Uncheck "C Compiler Listing" 
- Previous issues from v1.1.0 does still apply







nRF518 SDK v1.1.0
-----------------

Following toolchains/devices have been used for testing and verification:
- ARM: MDK-ARM Version 4.54
- N51822 QFAACA on PCA10004 module on nRF6310 motherboard

- N51822 QFAACA on PCA10001 board
- Windows XP SP3 32-bit
- Windows 7 SP1 64-bit

Known issues:
- Examples use depracated PERPOWER register. Future silicon will power up peripherals after reset and PERPOWER register will be removed.
- Using Keil versions 4.53 and older will not work unless you change configuration in jlinksettings.ini. See User Guide for more details.
- Temperature example does not give sane output values. This is hardware related issue described in
- Segger JLink has some issues with Keil. See http://www.segger.com/IDE_Integration_Keil.html#knownproblems for more details.

- Gazell and ESB examples point to wrong SFR file (should be SFD\Nordic\nRF51\nRF51822.sfr). 
- Reset button wont work after programing without cycling the target power. Workaround is to update system_nrf51.c with 
  void SystemInit (void) 
  {
      /* Switch ON both RAM banks */
      NRF_POWER->RESET = POWER_RESET_RESET_Enabled;
      NRF_POWER->RAMON |= (POWER_RAMON_ONRAM0_RAM0On << POWER_RAMON_ONRAM0_Pos) |
                          (POWER_RAMON_ONRAM1_RAM1On << POWER_RAMON_ONRAM1_Pos);
  } 

Bluetooth:
  - The button on the evaluation board are not debounced in hardware and the application implementing for it does not debounce the button presses either (using software mechanisms). So there will be additional increments/decrements of heart rate measurement while pressing the buttons.

nRF514 SDK v.1.2.0
------------------

Following toolchains/devices have been used for testing and verification:
- ARM: MDK-ARM Version 4.60
- N51422 QFAACA on PCA10004 module on nRF6310 motherboard
- N51422 QFAACA on PCA10006 module on nRF6310 motherboard
- N51822 QFAACA on nRF2752 module on nRF6310 motherboard
- N51822 QFAACA on PCA10001 evaluation kit board
- Windows XP SP3 32-bit
- Windows 7 SP1 64-bit

Changes:
- Added Bicycle Power minimal slave example.
- Added Stride and Distance Monitor minimal slave and master example.
- Removed deprecated PERPOWER register from examples and header files.

Known issues:
- Segger JLink has some issues with Keil. See http://www.segger.com/IDE_Integration_Keil.html#knownproblems for more details.
- On some Windows XP machines JLink CDC installer fails with error message saying it could not find JLinkCDCDriver_x86.msi.
  - Try running the installer C:\Program Files\SEGGER\JLinkARM_V<version>\USBDriver\JLinkCDCInstaller_V1.2b.exe manually.
- When the bundled JLink OB CDC driver installation dialog appears, it might pop up an error saying "Failed to install driver (Timeout occurred)". Ignore it.
- Flashing a software using SEGGER is NOT possible when the device is in SYSTEM_OFF mode (implies to wake-up the current application from SYTEM_OFF before flashing a new application)
- Reset button won't work after programming with Keil without cycling the target power. On the other hand if nrfjprog with -p (pin reset) is used to program the device, reset button will work.
- Using -p option in nrfjprog too heavily might block JLink. This block can be resolved by re-cycling the JLink power.


nRF514 SDK v1.1.0
-----------------

Following toolchains/devices have been used for testing and verification:
- ARM: MDK-ARM Version 4.54
- N51422 QFAACA on PCA10001 module
- N51422 QFAACA on a PCA10005 modulea on nRF6310 motherboard

Known issues:
- When having an application which starts up by putting the chip in SystemOff mode, and wakeup source is not configured correctly, the device cannot be programmed.
  Workaround: Use nrfjprog with "recover" option to wipe the application keeping the application in SystemOff mode.
- For PCA10003 examples using UART, the terminal program on the PC has to release the COM port when PCA10003 is power cycled. It is not possible for the PCA10003 to keep a connection up when performing a power cycle.
  Workaround: Close terminal program for each time you want to perform a power recycle

Changes:
- Added examples for PCA10003 Evaluation kit.
- Added nrfjprog.exe - Nordic Semiconductor command line nRF51 programming tool using JLink dll's.

                          (POWER_RAMON_ONRAM1_RAM1On << POWER_RAMON_ONRAM1_Pos);
  } 
- Spi master function spi_master_init() sends two dummy bytes. This will be removed in a future release.
- timer_example nrf_timer_delay_ms() will not give expected results using parameter values over 65 ms.

Changes:
- First public release
