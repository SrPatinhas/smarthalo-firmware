/**
 * This project can be used as a starting point for developing a nRF5x series
 * mouse or keyboard using Gazell for communicating with a legacy nRF24LU1
 * USB dongle. It can communicate "out of the box" with the
 * Dongle reference design and the nRFreadySimplePairing.exe application,
 * that can be found in the nRFready Desktop v1.2.3.
 *
 * This project sends mouse movement packets to the USB dongle when pin 1
 * is low (button connected to pin 1 pressed) and sends the 'a' keyboard
 * character to the USB dongle when pin 2 goes from high to low (button
 * connected to pin 2 pressed).
